# Prompt Filtering System Development Plan (Final Version)

## 1. Project Setup
- You do not need to setup version control repository (Git). It is already setup in the project directory.
- Establish project structure and folder organization during setup phase
- No CI/CD system will be used; AI agents will handle testing
- Testing will be done directly in the environment

## 2. Technology Stack
- Backend: Python/Flask
- LLM Integration:
  - OpenAI endpoint: `http://172.28.16.136:1234/v1`
  - API key: `-` (no authentication needed)
  - Model: `mistralai/devstral-small-2507`
- Configuration Storage: JSON files
- Testing Framework: pytest

## 3. Core Components Implementation
### 3.1 Prompt Proxy
- Develop modular input/output interfaces
- Implement OpenAI-compatible prompt handling
- Add URI versioning support (`/v1/proxy`)

### 3.2 Categorizer LLM
- Integrate dedicated LLM for instruction categorization (same as backend LLM initially)
- Configure independently to allow future switching of LLM providers
- Develop API endpoints for categorization service

### 3.3 Filtering Engine
- Implement filtering logic based on categorized instructions
- Create configurable filtering criteria (JSON-based)
- Add logging for inputs, categorization results, and blocking decisions

### 3.4 Test Prompt Generator
- Develop LLM-powered tool for generating complexity prompts
- Create API endpoints for prompt generation service
- Run generated prompts through the filtering service as part of testing

## 4. Testing Framework
- Set up test-driven development environment with pytest
- Implement unit tests for all components
- Include error handling, edge case testing, and negative test cases
- Ensure tests can be run independently by QA engineers
- Fix code to match tests (not vice versa) unless there are fundamental implementation issues

## 5. Documentation
- Create comprehensive user guides
- Document configuration schema with examples
- Write technical reference documentation
- Develop API documentation with versioning information

## 6. Quality Assurance
- Conduct manual integration testing as part of development cycle
- No continuous integration workflows initially
- Prepare for potential QA engineer involvement in testing and improvement
