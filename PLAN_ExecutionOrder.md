# Execution Order Plan

## 1. Overview
This document defines the phase-by-phase development approach for the microservice architecture, ensuring minimal cross-team dependencies while maintaining clear integration points and coordination requirements.

## 2. Development Philosophy

### 2.1 Team Independence
- Each team works independently within their phase
- Clear API contracts defined upfront minimize coordination
- Teams can develop at their own pace within phase constraints
- Well-defined handoff points between phases

### 2.2 Risk Mitigation
- Foundation services developed first (most dependent services rely on them)
- Early validation of core assumptions through TDD
- Progressive integration reduces integration risk
- Clear rollback and iteration points
