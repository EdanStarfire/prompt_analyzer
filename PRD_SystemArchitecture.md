# Prompt Filtering System PRD (Final Version)

## 1. Introduction
The Prompt Filtering System is designed to proxy OpenAI-compatible prompts through a filter that uses its own dedicated LLM for categorizing instructions within the prompt. The system will then determine whether to allow or block the prompt based on predefined filtering criteria.

## 2. Objectives
- Develop a robust prompt filtering mechanism
- Create a tool for generating complexity prompts via an LLM for testing purposes
- Follow test-driven development practices throughout the project

## 3. System Components
1. **Prompt Proxy**: Handles incoming OpenAI-compatible prompts and routes them through the filter. The proxy mechanism should be modular on both input and output sides to support future expansion (e.g., adding Bedrock support).
2. **Categorizer LLM**: Dedicated language model for categorizing instructions within prompts
3. **Filtering Engine**: Evaluates categorized prompts against filtering criteria
4. **Test Prompt Generator**: Tool for generating complexity prompts to test the system

## 4. Functional Requirements
- Proxy OpenAI-compatible prompts through the filter
- Categorize instructions within prompts using a dedicated LLM
- Implement filtering logic to allow/block prompts
- Generate test prompts with varying complexity levels
- Support test-driven development workflows
- Handle errors gracefully, returning clear error messages as part of the response
- Log inputs, categorization results, and blocking decisions

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Modular architecture for future scalability (without unnecessary complexity for MVP)
- Performance optimization for real-time filtering
- Note: Security measures and high availability are not priorities for the initial MVP

## 6. Configuration Management
- JSON-based configuration files for filtering criteria
- Documentation of configuration schema with examples

## 7. Error Handling & Logging
- Graceful error handling for LLM calls and filtering operations
- Comprehensive logging of inputs, categorization results, and blocking decisions

## 8. API Versioning Strategy
- URI versioning will be used (e.g., `/v1/proxy`, `/v2/proxy`) to ensure backward compatibility while allowing evolution of the API

## 9. Documentation Requirements
- Detailed documentation of the configuration schema and usage
- Comprehensive guides for testing, building, and running all components

## 10. Deliverables
1. Detailed system architecture document
2. Implementation of all core components
3. Comprehensive test suite following TDD practices
4. Complete documentation package including user guides and technical references
