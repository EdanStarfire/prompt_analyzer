# Prompt Proxy Component Plan

## 1. Overview
The Prompt Proxy is responsible for handling incoming OpenAI-compatible prompts and routing them through the filtering system. It provides a modular interface that can be extended to support additional LLM providers in the future.

## 2. Implementation Requirements
- Develop modular input/output interfaces
- Implement OpenAI-compatible prompt handling
- Add URI versioning support (`/v1/proxy`)
- Integrate with the Categorizer LLM and Filtering Engine
- **Support bypass mode for live verification of proxying capabilities without filtering**

## 3. Dependencies
- Flask framework for API endpoints
- Categorizer LLM component (optional in bypass mode)
- Filtering Engine component (optional in bypass mode)

## 4. Interfaces
### Input Interface
```python
def handle_prompt(prompt: str, filter_enabled: bool = True) -> dict:
    """
    Handle incoming prompt and route through filtering system.

    Args:
        prompt: The input prompt string
        filter_enabled: Whether to apply filtering (False for bypass mode)

    Returns:
        dict: Response containing filtered result or error information
    """
```

### Output Interface
```python
def format_response(result: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Format the response for OpenAI-compatible output.

    Args:
        result: The filtering engine result

    Returns:
        dict: Formatted response
    """
```

## 5. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for prompt handling and response formatting
- Integration tests with Categorizer LLM and Filtering Engine
- Error handling and edge case testing
- **Tests for bypass mode functionality**

## 6. Execution
All dependencies should be managed via `uv` and executed using `uv run`. Testing should use `uv run pytest`.

## 7. Todo List
- [ ] Create Flask application structure
- [ ] Implement prompt handling endpoint (`/v1/proxy`)
- [ ] Develop input/output interface functions
- [ ] **Implement bypass mode for live verification**
- [ ] Integrate with Categorizer LLM (optional in bypass mode)
- [ ] Integrate with Filtering Engine (optional in bypass mode)
- [ ] Write unit tests using pytest
- [ ] Write integration tests

## 8. Commit Strategy
- Create commits for significant completions:
  - After creating Flask application structure
  - After implementing each interface function
  - After completing unit tests
  - After successful integration testing
